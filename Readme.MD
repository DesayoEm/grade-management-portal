# Academic Management System

## V1.0 (Current Implementation)
### Core Architecture
- CLI-based interface
- JSON file-based persistence layer
- In-memory case-insensitive student lookup optimization

### Data Model
- Student records with fixed subjects (Mathematics, Science, History)
- Grade storage with score validation (0-100 range)
- Basic academic performance metrics

### Core Functionality
1. Student Management
   - Add new students with validation (name format, duplicate prevention)
   - Remove student records
   - Update student grades
   - View comprehensive student listings

2. Academic Analytics
   - Calculate individual student averages
   - Identify top-performing students
   - Track failing students (threshold: 40%)
   - Generate class-wide grade distributions

3. Data Validation
   - Score range enforcement (0-100)
   - Student name format validation
   - Duplicate entry prevention
   - Input type verification

## V2.0 (Planned Migration)
### System Architecture
1. Backend Infrastructure
   - FastAPI-based RESTful API
   - PostgreSQL persistent storage
   - SQLAlchemy ORM integration
   - JWT-based authentication

2. Database Architecture
   - Normalized schema design
   - Referential integrity enforcement
   - Complex relationship modeling
   - Audit trail implementation

### Enhanced Data Model
1. Core Entities
   - Students (UUID-based identification)
   - Academic Periods (semester/session tracking)
   - Departments
   - Courses (with prerequisites)
   - Enrollments
   - Grades

2. Extended Student Profile
   - Biometric data storage
   - Academic history (JAMB scores, SSCE results)
   - Demographic information
   - Document management (PDF storage)
   - Profile image handling

### Security Implementation
1. Authentication & Authorization
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   - OAuth2 implementation
   - Session management
   - JWT token lifecycle

2. User Hierarchy
   - Administrative staff
   - Students
   

### Advanced Features
1. Academic Workflow
   - Dynamic course enrollment
   - Prerequisite validation
   - Credit load management
   - Course approval workflow

2. Grade Management
   - Weighted CGPA calculation
   - Semester-wise GPA tracking
   - Academic standing computation
   - Performance analytics

3. Search & Analytics
   - Full-text search capability
   - Advanced filtering mechanisms
   - Academic performance trending
   - Cohort analysis

### Technical Specifications
1. API Design
   - RESTful endpoint architecture
   - Request/Response validation
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - Error handling protocols

2. Database Optimization
   - Indexing strategy
   - Query optimization
   - Connection pooling
   - Cache implementation

3. Security Measures
   - Password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Input sanitization
   - CORS configuration
   - Audit logging
